## 1. Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

# Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-data-analysis.git
```

# Change to the project directory
```bash
cd weather-data-analysis
```

# Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Data Preprocessing

The data_preprocessing.py script is responsible for loading the weather dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing the data for further analysis.
```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
```

3. Data Visualization

The data_visualization.py script focuses on visualizing correlations and patterns within the dataset using heatmaps, pair plots, and time-based temperature plots.
```bash
python data_visualization.py
```
4. Regression Project

The projekt_regresja.py script involves regression analysis on the weather data. It includes linear regression and polynomial regression to model relationships between variables.

```bash
python projekt_regresja.py
```
5. Usage
